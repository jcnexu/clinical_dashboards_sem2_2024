# Clinical Dashboards Semester 2 2024

Welcome to our repository! Before you read this, make sure you've read our [wiki](https://github.com/jcnexu/clinical_dashboards_sem2_2024/wiki)!

Here is a brief summary of what each file in this repository contains:

1. `old_data_dict.ipynb`: This is the notebook we used to preprocess Simulacrum V1, which we didn't end up using in the end. We kept the notebook here for safekeeping.
2. `new_data_dict.ipynb`: This is the notebook we used to preprocess Simulacrum V2 as well as prepare it for uploading to REDCap.
3. `upload_api.ipynb`: This is the notebook we used to upload our preprocessed data onto REDCap using the API. The import_data_to_redcap function was taken from the previous intake's [Github repository](https://github.com/Clinical-Informatics-Collaborative/Clinical_Dashboard_24sem1/blob/main/1.%20Upload%20file%20to%20Redcap/redcap_import.ipynb).
