# Clinical Dashboards Semester 2 2024

Welcome to our repository! Before you read this, make sure you've read our wiki (insert link)!

Here is a brief summary of what each file in this repository contains:

1. `old_data_dict.ipynb`: This is the notebook we used to preprocess Simulacrum V1, which we didn't end up using in the end but we still kept the notebook here for safekeeping.
2. `new_data_dict.ipynb`: This is the notebook we used to preprocess Simulacrum V2 as well as prepare it for uploading to REDCap.
3. `upload_api.ipynb`: This is the notebook we used to upload our preprocessed data onto REDCap using the API. The import_data_to_redcap function was taken from the previous intake's Github repository (insert link).
